             I am a very simple boy who is very loving towards his family. 
            I have many good friends. In my life, there are so many important 
            people but few are so significant without whom a single day is very 
            difficult which includes my mother, father, brother and sister.
            I am very attached to my mother. She is like a friend to me who 
            supports me at each and every step. My mom is a physician, 
            but then also she manages her time to spend some time with me.
