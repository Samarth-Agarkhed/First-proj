            I am a very simple boy who is very loving towards his family. 
            I have many good friends. In my life, there are so many important 
            people but few are so significant without whom a single day is very 
            difficult which includes my mother, father, brother and sister.
            I am very attached to my mother. She is like a friend to me who 
            supports me at each and every step. My mom is a physician, 
            but then also she manages her time to spend some time with me.

            She is a wonderful mother. She manages both her household and job very smoothly. 
            My sister is very supportive and caring. She understands me completely and is very 
            loving towards me. She is older than me and has always encouraged me to do the right
            thing. She is my best friend.
